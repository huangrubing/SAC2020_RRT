# SAC2021_RRT
More experimental results for our SAC 2021 paper, titled "Which Type of Exclusion Region is Better for Restricted Random Testing? An Empirical Study".

1. The files with the prefix "block" are the ART F-ratio reults for the block patterns (containing 2d and 3d input domains).
2. The files with the prefix "strip" are the ART F-ratio reults for the strip patterns (containing two failure rates: 0.001 and 0.005).
3. The files with the prefix "point" are the ART F-ratio reults for the point patterns (containing two failure rates: 0.001 and 0.005, and also with two different types of points: equal-sized points and different-sized points).
